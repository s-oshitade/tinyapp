## About
This project was completed by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seun-oshitade-53001120b/) as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/)). In-scope outcomes include working with cookies and sessions securely (using encrypted cookies), storing passwords securely (encryption vs hashing), permissions/user-authentication best practices, use of template (embedded javascript)engines to render web pages. Other concepts covered include: Creating RESTful web server endpoints, method overriding and analytics using knowledge of cookies.
